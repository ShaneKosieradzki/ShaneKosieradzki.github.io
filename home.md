Hello and welcome to my page.
My name is Shane Kosieradzki and this website captures my professional interests and academic achievements.
I consider myself to be a *Cryptographic Roboticist*, a term used to describe an emerging interdisciplinary field promising safety to an increasingly digital world.

I have trained in multiple different disciplines within the STEM universe and have melded my skill sets to the pursuit of cryptographically secure robotics systems.
This allows me to draw from multiple bodies of knowledge in my work for greater system excellence.
My areas of expertise are depicted in the Venn Diagram below:

    caption="This Venn Diagram captures the intersection of fields involved in the emerging discipline of *Cryptographic Robotics* as well as my area of expertise. The three fundamental disciplines composing the STEM mantra (Science, Engineering, Mathematics) form the foundation of the field, while their intersections produce the tools needed to realize an encrypted robotic system." %}

# What is Cryptographic Robotics?
The emerging field of *Cryptographic Robotics* can be understood as the combination of existing robotic technologies and methods with the sophistication of modern cryptography to produce novel methods that increase robotic systems security and reduce vulnerability.

## Why we need it.
The beginning of the 21st century has been marked by widespread integration of digital devices into our daily lives.
These digital assets have provided incredible utility and have facilitated levels of communication on a global scale.
While this is a remarkable accomplishment for humanity is also introduces a new vulnerability that did not exist before.
