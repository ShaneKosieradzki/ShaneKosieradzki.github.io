title: Rewrite Rules
abstract: "This paper presents topological sorting methods to minimize the multiplicative depth of encrypted arithmetic expressions.
    The research aims to increase compatibility between nonlinear dynamic control schemes and homomorphic encryption methods, which are known to be limited by the quantity of multiplicative operations. The proposed method adapts rewrite rules originally developed for encrypted binary circuits to depth manipulation of arithmetic circuits.The paper further introduces methods to normalize circuit paths that have incompatible depth. Finally, the paper provides benchmarks demonstrating the improved depth in encrypted computed torque control of a dynamic manipulator and discusses how achieved improvements translate to increased cybersecurity."
