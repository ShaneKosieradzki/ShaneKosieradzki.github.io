In this paper an overview abotu the upcoming version 2.0 of FMI is given that combines the formerly separated interfaces for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation in one standard. Based on the experience on using FMI 1., many small details have been improved and new features introduced to ease the use and increase the performance especially for larger models. Additionally, a free FMI compliance checker is available and FMI models from different tools are made available on the web to simplify testing},

There are two versions for these problems: the partial version (PACD) and the general version (GACD). The seemingly easier problem PACD was recently used by Coron et al. at CRYPTO '11 to build a more efficient variant of the FHE scheme by van Dijk et al.. We present a new PACD algorithm whose running time is essentially the ``square root'' of that of exhaustive search, which was the best attack in practice. This allows us to experimentally break the FHE challenges proposed by Coron et al. Our PACD algorithm directly gives rise to a new GACD algorithm, which is exponentially faster than exhaustive search. Interestingly, our main technique can also be applied to other settings, such as noisy factoring and attacking low-exponent RSA.}

The main aim of this study is to summarize the knowledge of hardware performance, security strength, and suitability for the cryptographic system from the different classes of RNGs. It discusses the different classes of RNGs, recalls the basic ideas, and provides the details of several well-known RNGs. This work presents a comprehensive discussion on the hardware implementation of RNGs on FPGAs. A complete list of LCGs-based pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) is presented with deep technical details on their mathematical formation and implementations. Finally, the performance of RNGs with respect to utilization of FPGA resources, frequency, latency, power consumption, security strength using the national institute of statistical testing (NIST), and weaknesses is presented.}

	abstract     = {We begin this chapter with a fundamental result of number theory, discovered by Pierre de Fermat. Fermat lived from 1601 to 1665. Many of his contemporaries were ``number-lovers'' rather than number theorists, [108, p. 51], and one thing that interested them was perfect numbers (a number is perfect if it is the sum of all its proper divisors). Bernard Fr{\'e}nicle de Bessy, who was also a mathematician and physicist, first raised the question of whether there was a perfect number of 20 digits and, if not, what the next largest perfect number was. (See [29] and [30].) The answer to the question required determining whether certain large numbers were prime. As a consequence, the men began corresponding. In a letter to Fr{\'e}nicle, dated October 18, 1640, Fermat stated what is now known as Fermat's theorem or Fermat's little theorem (to distinguish it from Fermat's last theorem), but he did not include a proof. In 1736, almost a century later, Leonhard Euler gave the first rigorous proof of the little theorem. Though this theorem is clearly theoretical in nature, it plays an important role in primality testing; that is, in deciding whether or not a certain number is prime. Fermat's little theorem (in the form due to Euler) is also the mathematical heart of the widely used RSA code that we will describe later in this chapter. In fact, Fermat's little theorem is not little at all.}

For a class of denial-of-service (DoS) attack models, the goal is to find an (optimal) causal feedback controller that minimizes a given objective function subject to safety and power constraints. We present a semi-definite programming based solution for solving this problem. Our analysis also presents insights on the effect of attack models on solution of the optimal control problem.},

Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique challenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the “smart” grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new security challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber-physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid. A concerted effort by the entire industry, the research community, and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure smart grid infrastructure.},

This approach could result in an undesirable disclosure of information on the initial state of an agent to the other agents. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving average consensus algorithm to guarantee the privacy of the initial state and asymptotic consensus on the exact average of the initial values, by adding and subtracting random noises to the consensus process. We characterize the mean square convergence rate of our consensus algorithm and derive the covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimate on the initial state. Moreover, we prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it does not disclose any information more than necessary to achieve the average consensus. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

Cyberphysical systems have permeated modern society, becoming prevalent in many domains, including energy production, health care, and telecommunications. Examples of cyberphysical systems include sensor networks, industrial automation systems, and critical infrastructures such as transportation networks, power generation and distribution networks, water and gas distribution networks, and advanced manufacturing systems. The integration of cybertechnologies with physical processes increases system efficiencies and, at the same time, introduces vulnerabilities that undermine the reliability of critical infrastructures. As recently highlighted by the Maroochy water breach in March 2000 [1], multiple recent power blackouts in Brazil [2], the SQL Slammer worm attack on the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in January 2003 [3], the StuxNet computer worm in June 2010 [4], and various industrial security incidents [5], cyberphysical systems are prone to failures and attacks on their physical infrastructure and cyberattacks on their data management and communication layer [6], [7].},

These schemes are capable of securely computing arbitrary degree polynomials homomorphically. In practice, ciphertext size and running times limit the polynomial degree, but this appears sufficient for most practical applications. We present four schemes, with increasing levels of security, but increasing computational overhead. Two of the schemes provide strong security for high-entropy data. The remaining two schemes provide strong security regardless of this assumption. These four algorithms form the first two levels of a hierarchy of schemes, and we also present the general cases of each scheme. We further elaborate how a fully homomorphic system can be constructed from one of our general cases. In addition, we present a variant based upon Chinese Remainder Theorem secret sharing. We detail extensive evaluation of the first four algorithms of our hierarchy by computing low-degree polynomials. The timings of these computations are extremely favourable by comparison with even the best of existing methods and dramatically outperform many well-publicised schemes. The results clearly demonstrate the practical applicability of our schemes.},
